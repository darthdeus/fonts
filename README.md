# Fantasque Sans Mono Compact

A small fontforge python script for adjusting the width of [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans).

The main reason for this repo is that IntelliJ IDEs don't allow changing the font letter spacing. It might be possible to do this in a better way (related issue https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/issues/164), but I just wanted something quick and dirty that'd work. Here's the related issue for IntelliJ https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-5247/Allow-to-change-the-letterspacing-of-a-font but I have little faith in that changing since it's been open for 9 years.

However, the solution in this repo seems to work very well. Only downside is that it requires the user to generate the font themselves unless want the same value that I generated :) (which is 90% width).
